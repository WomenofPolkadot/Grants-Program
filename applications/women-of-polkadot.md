## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview
Women of Polkadot is an organization dedicated to promoting gender diversity within the Polkadot ecosystem by supporting and increasing the participation of women. Our project aims to create a central hub for the Women of Polkadot community. This will be a space where members can connect, share knowledge, and grow together.

### Project Details
The project focuses on building a comprehensive platform that includes a website, community resources, and tools to foster engagement among women in the Polkadot ecosystem. Once it's live, this platform will be the base for all the activities and initiatives that will take place. By launching a website, we aim to become the go-to place for women in the Polkadot ecosystem and for women interested in it. The site will feature essential updates, resources, and events that encourage active participation and bring new members into the community.

Through features like the membership registration system and NFT minting, members will experience a streamlined process for joining and participating in the community. NFTs represent an interesting way to showcase ownership. With their implementation, we can build a gated space with features only members can enjoy.  

The inclusion of an event organization toolkit, along with secured access to event media through NFTs, ensures that organizing and attending community events is seamless and secure. Growing the community will happen also thanks to events organized by the project and community members. Each woman brings value, new ideas, and opinions to our ecosystem.  

Overall, our project will help create a vibrant and engaged community filled with opportunities for learning, sharing, and growth within the Polkadot ecosystem. By focusing on these strategic areas, we will create a platform that is not only informative and useful but also empowering and inclusive.

### Ecosystem Fit
- **Role in the Ecosystem:** To enhance diversity and inclusion by supporting women's participation in the Polkadot ecosystem. Community building will lead to building stronger connections and collaborations in the ecosystem. 
- **Target Audience:** 
  - Newcomers to the Polkadot ecosystem.
  - Existing women participants in the ecosystem.
- **Comparison to Existing Solutions:** At the moment, there is no other project that actively focuses on women and bringing women to the ecosystem. There were some initiatives, but they did not lead anywhere and ended up inactive. Our project will create a strong base for the women who will be interested in joining and working together with us. Women of Polkadort will provide a platform and better structure to those interested in building within the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Team's Experience
Linda Mohamadova is an experienced community organizer and has not previously applied for a grant from the Web3 Foundation. With a master's degree in International Management, she gained experience from studies abroad and various work experiences in the economic field. Early in 2022, she started to actively engage with the Polkadot ecosystem by working with the [KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz/) team as a part of the operations team and later became Head of Artists Relations. During this time, she organized or co-organized many Polkadot events, thanks to which she became Polkadot ambassador and later senior ambassador. Many of these contributions can be seen in her senior ambassador [application form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hNggtTZPedkrg3Ux6RoFQIdTu12TZKZs1X1oKtJGemQ/edit). Linda is an active member of the community, attending many blockchain conferences to represent our ecosystem, and is strongly focused on connecting people and bringing more value to Polkadot. 

She is also part of the initiative [uniFires](https://discord.gg/Zn4F9JKhEt), a cross-chain collaboration between the Cardano and Polkadot ecosystems. The initiative funded by [Project Catalyst](https://projectcatalyst.io/) focuses on three main areas: Web3 adoption, open governance, and cross-chain interoperability knowledge sharing. Linda is the lead of the Web3 adoption group, where she organizes workshops with people from both ecosystems to discuss the challenges and opportunities that lie between the two ecosystems. 

The idea of Women of Polkadot started as a way to connect with women in the ecosystem, but after many discussions and opportunities to chat with women in the ecosystem, it was decided that it would be useful to have a proper platform.

## Future Plans
- Be the first to establish a hub for women in the Polkadot ecosystem.
- Continue to organize events coinciding with major Polkadot conferences, such as Sub0 and Decoded.
- There is potential to evolve into a DAO, akin to numerous comparable initiatives in other ecosystems.
- Attract and encourage talented women to join the fellowship; currently, there are no women, which highlights the need for enhanced diversity in top positions.
- Develop the initiative and platform by introducing innovative ideas and features as requested by our audience.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:
**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** The Web3 Grants Program is known in the ecosystem, and there are a lot of materials that can be found if someone is curious. The idea about participating sparked after Linda had a call with Nathalie Boyke, during which they were talking about women's participation in various events. 

**Additional Notes:**
- To date, Women of Polkadot has not applied for any Web3 Foundation grants. However, we have received two financial contributions from Events Bounty to cover costs for organizing two side events ([Sub0 2023 in Lisbo](https://lu.ma/dzuqx5nw?tk=4Tf3CX)n and [Sub0 2024 in Bangkok](https://lu.ma/breakfastbkk)).
